packages are made up of modules

https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/golang-course-code

every go file must be part of a package.

if you have both files as part of eg main package, no import statement is required. functions are shared across files, but imports arenÂ´t. eg fmt.

every package must have its own subfolder

only upper case funcs and vars are available in other packages.

go get github.com/Pallinder/go-randomdata

go get is the global install

# pointers

variables that store value addresses instead of values

why pointers

1. avoid unnecessary value copies
2. directly mutate values

dereferencing = \*varName = gives the value of the address stored as a pointer

you can't perform pointer maths

pointers to structs don't need to be dereferenced.

with anonymous embedding you can access the fields and methods directly on the struct
