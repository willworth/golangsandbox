Absolutely, I'd be glad to help you organize your Go projects. Go, also known as Golang, has a specific way of managing packages and modules which can be a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's quite powerful and straightforward.

### Understanding Modules and Packages in Go

1. **Modules**: A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a `go.mod` file at its root. The `go.mod` file defines the module's module path, which is also the import path used for the root directory, and its dependency requirements.

2. **Packages**: Each directory inside your module can be a separate package, and a package is a way to organize and reuse code in Go. You can think of a package as a project or a library.

### Project Structure

Given your requirements, here's how you can structure your project:

```
/my-golang-projects
|-- go.mod (Your module file)
|-- project1
|   |-- main.go
|-- project2
|   |-- main.go
|-- project3
|   |-- main.go
...
```

- `/my-golang-projects` is your repository root and also the root of your Go module.
- Each `projectX` directory is a separate package with its own `main.go` file.
- You only need one `go.mod` file at the root.

### How to Run Projects

- To run a specific project, navigate to the project's directory and run `go run main.go`. This will compile and execute the `main` function in that specific project.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- **Organization**: Keeps all your projects under one repository while maintaining separation.
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and navigate.
- **Dependency Management**: Common dependencies across projects can be managed efficiently in a single `go.mod` file.

**Cons**:

- **Dependency Overhead**: If projects have vastly different dependencies, the `go.mod` file might get cluttered.
- **Namespace**: Each project needs to be in its own directory to avoid namespace collisions.

### Example `go.mod` File

Here's an example of what your `go.mod` file might look like:

```go
module github.com/yourusername/my-golang-projects

go 1.16

require (
    // Your dependencies here
)
```

### Initializing a New Module

If you're starting fresh, you can create a new module by running:

```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/my-golang-projects
```

### Adding a New Project

When you add a new project, simply create a new directory under the root and add your Go files there. No need to modify the `go.mod` file unless you're adding new dependencies.

### Final Tips

- Keep each project's dependencies minimal and necessary.
- Regularly run `go mod tidy` to clean up unused dependencies.
- Use version control (like Git) to track changes and manage versions of your projects.

By following this structure, you can maintain multiple projects under a single repository without them interfering with each other, and manage dependencies efficiently.
