In Go, pointers are a fundamental concept that allows you to reference and manipulate the memory address of a value. The `*` and `&` symbols are central to working with pointers, but they serve different purposes:

### The `*` Symbol

1. **Pointer Type Declaration**: When used in a type declaration, the `*` symbol is used to denote a pointer to a type. For example, `*int` represents a pointer to an `int`, and `*user` represents a pointer to a `user` type.

   ```go
   var x *int // x is a pointer to an int
   ```

2. **Dereferencing a Pointer**: When used in an expression, the `*` symbol is used to dereference a pointer, i.e., to access the value at the memory address the pointer points to.

   ```go
   var x int = 10
   var p *int = &x
   *p = 20 // sets the value of x to 20 by dereferencing p
   ```

In your `clearUsername` function, `*user` indicates that the function is defined on a pointer receiver to a `user` type. This means the function can modify the fields of the `user` instance it's called on, as it has a reference to the memory address of that instance.

### The `&` Symbol

1. **Address Operator**: The `&` symbol is used to get the address of a variable, essentially creating a pointer to the variable. It's used when you want to obtain a pointer pointing to the variable's memory address.

   ```go
   var x int = 10
   var p *int = &x // p now holds the address of x
   ```

### Example in Practice

Consider the following code snippet that illustrates these concepts:

```go
type user struct {
    firstName string
    lastName  string
}

func (u *user) clearUsername() { // u is a pointer to a user instance
    u.firstName = ""
    u.lastName = ""
}

func main() {
    usr := user{firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"}
    usr.clearUsername() // Method called on the user instance

    // Even though we're not using &usr to call the method,
    // Go automatically understands it should pass the pointer to the usr instance.
    // This is syntactic sugar provided by Go for calling methods with pointer receivers.
}
```

In this example:

- `u *user` in the method receiver position indicates that `clearUsername` operates on a pointer to a `user` instance, allowing it to modify the `user`'s fields.
- Inside the `main` function, when `usr.clearUsername()` is called, Go automatically takes the address of `usr` (as if `&usr.clearUsername()` was written) because `clearUsername` is defined with a pointer receiver.

By using a pointer receiver in your method (`u *user`), you ensure that any modifications made to `u` within the method affect the original `user` instance, rather than a copy of it. This is crucial for methods that need to update or mutate the state of the instance they're called on.
